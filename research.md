    We investigate the optimal time-consistent use of foreign exchange interventions (FXI) in a small open economy model driven by endowment and portfolio flow shocks. The model features endogenous FX market depth, which reflects limited risk-bearing capacity of FX traders, and optimal FXI policy is subject to a lower bound on FX reserves. In a competitive equilibrium, large capital flows increase conditional exchange rate volatility and make FX markets more shallow. Unlike in the unconstrained case, the central bank's optimal interventions are not solely targeted at offsetting fluctuations in the demand for currency but also incorporate a forward-looking element due to the risk of depleting reserves. We show that this consideration leads to optimal time-consistent FXI policy that responds less (more) than one-for-one to large (small) capital outflows. The policy delivers sizable welfare gains, exceeding those from simple FXI rules. Yet, these gains depend on sufficiently high initial reserves. When reserves are low, time inconsistency matters and commitment becomes more valuable.

FX Market Depth and Exchange Rate Volatility <span style="font-weight:400;">(Job Market Paper)</span>

  <p>
    Using security holdings data of globally diversified mutual funds, I employ a granular instrumental variable approach to identify currency demand shocks at the bilateral exchange rate level. These shocks cause significant exchange rate movements for both emerging market (EM) and advanced economy (AE) currencies, consistent with the view that FX markets are inelastic—or “shallow.” My estimates show that market depth is orders of magnitude lower for EM than for AE currencies. Moreover, I uncover a state dependence: during periods of high expected exchange rate volatility, FX markets are markedly inelastic, whereas in tranquil periods they are nearly perfectly elastic.

Crowding out Foreign Investment: Costs of Foreign Exchange Intervention <span style="font-weight:400;"></span>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>
    This paper introduces foreign investment in a small open economy model and studies its implications for foreign exchange intervention (FXI) policy. Due to aggregate demand externalities, overborrowing and unemployment may arise in the economy. In this case, FXI can increase employment by improving the net foreign asset position ex-ante, but comes with the cost of crowding out higher-yielding foreign investment. As a result, the optimal policy problem features two local optima: one with low FXI and positive foreign investment holdings, and one with high FXI and no foreign investment. Whether the former or latter constitutes the global optimum crucially depends on the risk/return profile of foreign investment.
